= Introduction =

The aim of this project is to have a UI interface, interacted through gaze/eye tracking and blink detection, for people with disabilities/paralysis that are unable to verbally communicate or use a keyboard.

== Goals ==
  * Maintain as open source under the LGPL license, and as such, a free program (outside of the hardware, which is roughtly $100CDN to build, and estimated at $70US, compared to thousands of dollars for a retail package of hardware and software)
  * Create an interface that does not require keyboard/mouse interaction (or keep it to an absolute minimum)
    * This software should allow the user to be as independent as possible
  * Accurately track the eye in the program, while ignoring eye movement not relevant to the program (such as looking away from the screen)
  * Have an extendable interface that allows various styled programs to be used through this interface such as:
    * Basic text editting
    * Simple media player
    * Access to the internet/email
  * _more to come_

== Limitations ==
This software includes calibration that does not account for head movement, meaning the head needs to remain fairly steady for the most optimal use.  To counteract this, instead of tracking a single eye point on the screen, like a mouse, this system uses rectangular interaction.  What this means is instead of looking at coordinate (100, 100) on the screen, you are looking in the box of (98, 98)-(102, 102).  The reason here is the eye tracking can be somewhat unstable, even when the head is quite study, so there is a slight jitter - by decreasing the pixel resolution to smaller boxes, the jitter can be minimized or even removed completely, depending on the rectangle resolution used.
