#summary How to build the hardware
#labels Deprecated

== Materials ==
  * A webcam
    * I used a PS3Eye Camera, and you can find modding instructions [http://peauproductions.com/ps3_media.html here].
  * Infrared LEDs
    * I have used two per headset, but it's probably possible with one IR LED
    * I got mine at Radioshack/The Source in the remote control repair kits (also comes with an infrared receiver, which we don't need)
      * You could definitely buy these cheaper (and get more) if you know of an electronics hobbyist store, or a warehouse.
  * A pair of sunglasses
    * Make sure it'll be easy to pop the lenses out of them
  * A metal rod (about a foot long
    * My cousin had a welding rod that we chipped off the "crust," sanded down, and bent into shape
    * I would recommend an aluminum or copper rod, because they will be slightly more flexible (which is good)
  * One AAA battery holder (should support 2 batteries at a time)
  * 2 AAA batteries
  * Wire ties
  * Strong adhesive *OR* a mount system for the metal rod
    * I used epoxy (industrial glue, essentially), but if you could find a screw mount system for the rod, that would work, too, and be more adjustable)
  * Electrical tape
